		   README FILE FOR SINGULAR KERNEL
		   ===============================

This directory contains the source files for the Singular kernel and
the following subdirectories:
 
  'doc'	  -- contains sources for Singular documentation files 
  'check' -- contains a small Singular self-test
  'LIB'   -- contains Singular libraries written in Singular's
             programming language

See the following files in this directory
  'INSTALL' -- for information on how to install Singular
  'COPYING' -- for copying and license information

See below for an overview of Singular, and for distribution and
support information.

If you receive this file as part of a complete Singular distribution,
see also the README.src, COPYING.src, and INSTALL files contained in the top
directory of the full Singular distribution.


Overview of Singular
====================
Singular is a special-purpose computer algebra system for commutative
algebra and algebraic geometry. The main features of Singular are:

 * Computations in very general rings (polynomial rings, localizations
   of rings at a prime ideal, tensor products of rings) over many
   ground fields (rational numbers, mod p numbers, Galois fields,
   transcendental/algebraic extensions) and monomial orderings (all
   standard monomial orderings, including matrix orderings)

 * Very fast standard (resp. Groebner) bases computations

 * Polynomial factorization, resultant, and gcd computations

 * Large variety of implemented related algorithm: FGLM,
   Hilbert-driven, Factorizing Buchberger; Minimal resolutions,
   Primary decomposition; Usual ideal theoretic operations; standard
   combinatorial algorithms.

 * Efficient and flexible communication links based on the MP
   protocol and library

 * Easy-to-use, command-driven user-interface

 * Intuitive, C-like programming language

 * Extensive libraries of procedures, written in Singular's
   programming language

 * Written in C/C++. Available as source and binary for some hard- and
   software platforms (including most Un*x variants, MS-DOG, MacOS)


Distribution of Singular
========================
The newest version of Singular is always available by anonymous ftp
from 
	     www.mathematik.uni-kl.de:/pub/Math/Singular

Binary versions of Singular for common hard- and software
platforms are contained in the files Singular-1.0.<platform>.gz where
<platform> is, for example, 'linux', 'SunOS', etc.  See the file
README.bin for more information about the distribution of Singular
binaries.

Architecture - independent files (such as libraries written in the
Singular programming language, and the Singular documentation) are
distributed as Singular-1.0-share.tar.gz. See the file README.share
for more information. 

In general, Singular is only available as binary program. For
exceptions, you may contact us at
        singular@mathematik.uni-kl.de

The source is distributed in two versions:
  1. A full source distribution of Singular is contained in
     Singular-full-1.0.tar.gz.  This (gzip'ed and tar'ed) file
     contains the source code, documentation, and supporting data
     files for the Singular kernel, and for all add-on packages,
     i.e. for the GMP, MP, Factory, and Libfac libraries.

  2. A kernel source distribution of Singular can be found in
     Singular-1.0.tar.gz This (gzip'ed and tar'ed) contains the
     sources, documentation and supporting data files for Singular,
     only, i.e., it comes WITHOUT the sources for any of the add-on
     packages.


Documentation to Singular is distributed as:
Singular-1.0.dvi.gz	 - Reference manual in dvi format
Tutorial.dvi.gz		 - Singular tutorial in dvi format
Singular-1.0.ps.gz	 - Reference manual in postscript format
Tutorial.dvi.gz		 - Singular tutorial in postscript format
singular.hlp.gz		 - Reference manual in Info format
Singular-1.0.html.tar.gz - Reference manual in html format
